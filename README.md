## Description

This tool produces a quick and professional README file for your project based on the information you give it. It accepta a title, description, installation instructions, usage/userstory, credits, license type, contribution guidelines, testing information, your email, and your github username.

The description and the credits open your default text editor so you can format them in Markdown style to your liking. The license section provides you with several open source license tyoe for you to choose. The tool will give you a txt file of your choosen license to add to your project with a link in the final README.md. The contribution guideline defaults to the Contributor Covenant, but you are able to enter your own custom guideline if you wish. Your email and Github will auto generate links to their respective sites and email programs.

If your happy with how your README turned out, great! Otherwise, once the basic file is generated, you can use it as an easy template to add what ever extra content you like.
